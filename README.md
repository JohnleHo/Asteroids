## Description
Asteroids is an attempt at a recreation of the 1979 Atari classic, Asteroids - the primary premise of the game is to survive an endless horde of incoming asteroids, racking up points along the way. 
There are three tiers (sizes) of asteroids (small, medium, and large) that break up into smaller and smaller asteroids when destroyed.
