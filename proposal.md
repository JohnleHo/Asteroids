## Description
My final project for ANGM 2305 will be a recreation of the 1979 Atari classic, Asteroids.
It will be a relatively simple video game that should demonstrate the knowledge/abilities I learned from this class' lessons, lectures, and challenges. 

## Features
- Player
	- a player controller that can 1: move forward, 2: rotate 360 degrees, and 3: shoot projectiles.
  - no brakes - the player can only slow/stop themselves by moving in the opposite direction.
  - this will be handled via methods, functions, etc. from the Pygame module.
- Obstacles
	- asteroids that slowly move around the screen - they will kill/damage the player if touched.
  - varying sizes and speeds.
  - this will be handled via methods, functions, etc. from the Pygame module.
- Objectives
	- the player will earn score for every asteroid destroyed - there will be a high-score board.
  - this will be handled via methods, functions, etc. from the Pygame module.

## Challenges
- I will need to learn how to properly implement the movement behind the player controller - the physics need to be receptive yet challenging.
- I will need to learn how to implement art/sprite-work for my game's assets - I may also need to learn how add SFX & BGM.
- I will need to learn how to implement various UI elements w/ game mechanics (e.g., scorekeeping, high-score board, main menu(?) - settings(?), etc.).

## Outcomes
Ideal Outcome:
- The ideal outcome of this project is a simple, straightforward recreation of Atari's 1979 Asteroids.

Minimal Viable Outcome:
- The bare minimum for a good working outcome is 1: a controllable player, 2: obstacles and objectives, and 3: a simple gameplay loop.
